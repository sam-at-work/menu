# Restuarant Menu Demo

I wanted to make a website that used ReactRouter.

I picked a restuarant menu because it conveniently has sections (and in the future I will add sub sections.)

Static Site - GitHub Pages
- [react-router](https://cra-with-api-lzhnvfcnvl.now.sh)

Static Page served from Node Server - Zeit
- [Demo](https://sam-at-work.github.io/menu/)
